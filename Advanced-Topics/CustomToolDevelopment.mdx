# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced topics related to AgentScript AI.

## State Management and Persistence

AgentScript AI provides built-in support for state management and persistence. The state of an agent and its tools is automatically serialized and can be stored in a database. This allows for:

*   **Resumability:** Agents can be paused and resumed later, even after a system restart.
*   **Long-Running Tasks:** Agents can perform long-running tasks without losing their state.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Workflows:** Agents can pause execution and wait for human input.

## Human-in-the-Loop Interactions

AgentScript AI makes it easy to add human-in-the-loop interactions to your agents. Tools can be designed to:

*   **Pause Execution:** Wait for user input or approval before continuing.
*   **Display Interactive Messages:** Show buttons or other interactive elements in a chat interface.
*   **Update State Based on User Input:** Modify the agent's state based on user interactions.

## Observability and Debugging

AgentScript AI provides tools for observing and debugging your agents:

*   **Logging:** The runtime logs all actions and events, making it easy to track the execution flow.
*   **State Inspection:** You can inspect the state of the agent and its tools at any point in time.
*   **Step-by-Step Execution:** You can step through the execution of the agent's script to understand its behavior.

## Custom Tool Development

AgentScript AI allows you to create custom tools that can be used by your agents. Custom tools can:

*   **Integrate with External APIs:** Connect to any external service or API.
*   **Perform Complex Logic:** Implement custom logic that is not supported by the built-in tools.
*   **Maintain State:** Store and retrieve data between calls.
*   **Handle User Interactions:** Provide interactive elements for user input.
